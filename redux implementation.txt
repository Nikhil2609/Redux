REDUX Fundamental and Implementation

defination: 
 - Redux is a client side state management library (we can manage global state using REDUX)

Fundamental 
 - Actions (action)
 - Reducer (a function that is used to modify or update state changes)
 - store (state)

Implentatation
 1) add redux , react-redux npm dependecy  (npm install redux react-redux)
 2) provide store to whole app in root file  
 	(so that we can access store(state) globally with props (inside class component we can access though props))

 		<Provider store = {store}> 
 			<App />
 		</provider>
 3) create store ,then reducer , then actions

 4) mapStateToProps
	mapDispathToProps
	export default connect(mapStateToProps,mapDispathToProps)(App)

	- now we can access state using props
	- also we can update global state using reducer function

 4) to update state call dispatch method in functional component

==================================================================
- create file structure for react and redux 
- provide store to main application

now user state variable in application
and then dispatch action

we can use global store like this in class component

this.props.counter
this.props.increment()

mapStateToProps
mapDispathToProps
export default connect(mapStateToProps,mapDispathToProps)(App)

note : 
- upgrade react and react-dom to latest 18.1.0
